          Remo Medical Outreach is a non-profit NGO dedicated to providing free healthcare 
          services to underserved communities across Nigeria. We believe healthcare is a right, 
          not a privilege.

        <p className="mb-6">
          Since our founding, we have reached thousands of people through free medical check-ups, 
          health awareness campaigns, and surgical interventions â€” saving lives and restoring hope.
